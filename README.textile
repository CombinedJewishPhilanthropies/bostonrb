h1. Boston.rb

This is the source code to "Boston.rb":http://bostonrb.org, a Rails app which helps Boston Rubyists communicate.

It is open source under the MIT license. Fork away, modify to your own user group's needs, & send us pull requests!

h2. Dependencies

All gems are vendored except for Nokogiri & JSON, which have native extensions, & Cucumber, which doesn't respect vendoring.

Install:

    Cucumber 0.3.5
    JSON     1.1.6

h2. Tests

We use Cucumber & Webrat for acceptance testing and Shoulda, Factory Girl, & Mocha for unit testing. We use Fakeweb to stop the test suite from hitting external services. We use Nokogiri for parsing markup, especially in acceptance tests.

h2. Production

This must be added to cron:

    PATH_TO_APP/script/runner Cron.get_tweets
